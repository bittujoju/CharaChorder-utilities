# CharaChorder Utilities

Welcome to the CharaChorder Utilities project! This project contains a set of tools for CharaChorder users, including:

- Count Bigrams: a tool that helps you find infrequently occurring two letter chords to avoid accidental triggering.
- Convert Chord Map: a tool that helps you convert your chord map between QWERTY, Dvorak, and Colemak.
- Chord Statistics: a tool that provides statistics on your uploaded chord map, including the number of chords and breakdown by number of letters.
- ChordFinder: a tool that looks at your uploaded chord map and a text and finds common words and phrases in the text that you don't have chords for.
