# CharaChorder Utilities

Welcome to the CharaChorder Utilities project! This project contains a set of tools for CharaChorder users, including:

- Count Bigrams: a tool that helps you find infrequently occurring two letter chords to avoid accidental triggering.
- Convert Chord Map: a tool that helps you convert your chord map between QWERTY, Dvorak, and Colemak.
- Chord Statistics: a tool that provides statistics on your uploaded chord map, including the number of chords and breakdown by number of letters.
- ChordFinder: a tool that looks at your uploaded chord map and a text and finds common words and phrases in the text that you don't have chords for.
- Anagrams: this tool looks at a text and identifies all of the partial anagrams. Partial anagrams (like tough and thought) are usually words that you need special attention for choosing chord maps since they share the same overall letters.
